## Purpose and Scope

This document defines the list of features, and their descriptions, that Bithell Studios Ltd. agrees to provide to as part of the AdamRMS service. Bithell Studios Ltd. may choose to offer other features that are not listed here, but these fall outside the scope of any agreements and no service commitment is offered.

During the term of the agreement under which Bithell Studios Ltd has agreed to provide the AdamRMS SLA Covered Services to the given customer the features listed in the list titled "SLA 95" will be operational and available to customer at least 95% of the time in any calendar month (known as the Monthly Uptime Percentage). If Bithell Studios Ltd does not meet this metric of availability, and if customer meets its obligations under this and other agreements such as the terms of service, the customer will be eligible to receive credit on the invoice for the service in the subsequent billing month. In order to receive any credit, the customer must notify Bithell Studios Ltd within thirty days from the time customer becomes eligible to receive the credit. Failure to comply with this requirement will forfeit customer's right to receive the credit. The aggregate maximum amount of credits to be issued by Bithell Studios Ltd to customer for all downtime that occurs in a single calendar month shall not exceed the value of 15 days of service in the form of a monetary credit to a customer's invoice. The Bithell Studios Ltd Workspace SLA does not apply for any performance issues:
- caused by factors that are "Force Majeure" by nature, such as a internet outage who's causes include, but are not limited to: war, acts of terror, civil disobedience, natural disasters and extreme weather events. 
- that resulted from customer's equipment or third party equipment, or both (not within the primary control of Bithell Studios Ltd).
- that resulted from 3rd party contractors equipment or third party equipment, or both (not within the primary control of Bithell Studios Ltd).

 **This AdamRMS SLA states a customer's sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Bithell Studios Ltd to meet the AdamRMS SLA.**
